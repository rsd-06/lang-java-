/*                                    GENERATING RANDOM NUMBER IN JAVA

Java provides three ways to generate random numbers using some built-in methods and classes as listed below:

java.util.Random class
Math.random method : Can Generate Random Numbers of double type.
ThreadLocalRandom class



1) java.util.Random
For using this class to generate random numbers, we have to first create an instance of this class and then invoke methods such as
nextInt(), nextDouble(), nextLong() etc using that instance.
We can generate random numbers of types integers, float, double, long, booleans using this class.
We can pass arguments to the methods for placing an upper bound on the range of the numbers to be generated.
For example, nextInt(6) will generate numbers in the range 0 to 5 both inclusive.

Random rand = new Random();
int randomNum = rand.nextInt(max â€“ min + 1) + min;

or int randomNum = rand.nextInt(min,max) --> max is excluded !




2)Math.random()
The class Math contains various methods for performing various numeric operations such as, calculating exponentiation, logarithms etc.
One of these methods is random(), this method returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.
The returned values are chosen pseudo randomly. This method can only generate random numbers of type Doubles. Below program explains how to use this method:

System.out.println("Random doubles: " + Math.random());
( after importing java.util.random* )
